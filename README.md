# ðŸª– WarMate Chatbot - Indian Army Inspired

## Overview

This repository hosts the **WarMate Chatbot**, a tactical battlefield assistant inspired by the Indian Army. The frontend is built with modern web technologies, and the project is deployed as a static site on Firebase Hosting. 

Explore the live app here: [https://war-mate.web.app/](https://war-mate.web.app/)

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

The frontend is built with **React** (a JavaScript library for building UIs) and **TypeScript** (a typed superset of JavaScript) for robust development. We use **Vite** as the build tool, providing a fast development experience. UI components are styled using **shadcn/ui**, an open-source React component library.

For styling and layout, **Tailwind CSS** is used, a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid and consistent UI design with pre-built utility classes.

### Backend & Hosting

The backend logic and database are minimal or externalized; the main focus is on the frontend app. The finished app is deployed on **Firebase Hosting**, delivering a fast and secure static site globally.
